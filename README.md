# Xfile: Decentralized File Management

## Overview

Xfile is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to revolutionize file management by leveraging blockchain technology and IPFS. It provides a secure, efficient, and reliable platform for storing, managing, and sharing files without relying on centralized servers.

## Problem Statement

Traditional file management systems are centralized, making them vulnerable to data breaches, unauthorized access, and single points of failure. Xfile addresses these issues by offering a decentralized solution that ensures enhanced security, data integrity, and user control.

## Key Features

- **Enhanced Security:**
  - Immutable Records
  - Encryption
- **Decentralization:**
  - No Single Point of Failure
  - Resilient Network
- **Ownership and Control:**
  - User Control
  - Permission Management
- **Transparency and Accountability:**
  - Audit Trails
  - Compliance

## Solution Approach

Xfile combines blockchain technology with IPFS to create a decentralized file management system. Files are encrypted, stored on IPFS, and their hashes are recorded on the blockchain to ensure immutability and transparency.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum (Solidity) or another suitable blockchain platform
- **Storage:** IPFS
- **Encryption:** AES-256
